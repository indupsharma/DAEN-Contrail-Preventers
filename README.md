# DAEN-Contrail-Preventers
GitHub Repository for DAEN-690 Capstone Project

**Problem Statement**

Though a method has been proposed to eliminate contrails, the exact conditions that cause ice super saturated regions (ISSRs) are currently unknown. This project will build on the work performed in Spring 2023—using new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather balloon data—to develop a model to predict if contrails are likely to form based on current weather conditions. Further, in addition to the modeling effort, the dashboard developed will provide valuable insights into historic trends. Identifying the conditions where contrails are likely to form provides the airline industry with a method to reduce their impact on climate change at minimal cost.​

**Importance of Problem**

Contrails account for approximately 2% of total anthropogenic global heating. Since they are only in the atmosphere for a limited amount of time, eliminating contrails—by preventing airlines from flying in regions where contrails would form—would almost immediately resolve this source of global heating.
